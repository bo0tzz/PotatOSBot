# PotatOSBot
A bot that lets you retrieve Portal quotes within Telegram

This bot will let you search through a database to find audio clips of every voice line in the portal games. 
It's got several commands and an inline mode to let you send clips to your friends.

You can find this bot on Telegram at [@PotatOSBot](http://t.me/PotatOSBot). Unfortunately, it is currently undergoing maintenance. 
If you want to run the bot yourself, you can compile it with `mvn clean package`. You can find a list of all the audio files in [this repository](https://github.com/bo0tzz/Portal2CharacterDialogs)

Makes use of the [JavaTelegramBot-API](https://github.com/zackpollard/JavaTelegramBot-API).
